            <h2>About Kaidyn</h2>

            <p>Hello! My name is Kaidyn Calame and I am a freshman at Lake Land College in the Computer Information Technology (CIT) program. I am passionate about web development and enjoy building responsive, user-friendly websites.
                Growing up, I was always fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve problems and create new opportunities. This interest led me to pursue a degree in CIT, where I have been able to learn and grow my skills in programming, web development, and software engineering.
                In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, watching sports, and playing games. I have a strong work ethic and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a person. I am excited to see where my career in technology will take me and am eager to continue building my skills and knowledge in this field.
            </p>
