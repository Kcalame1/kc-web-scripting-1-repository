        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a Cowden-Herrick High School Graduate, currently pursuing a degree at Lake Land College.
            I love Jesus, my family, and my friends. I am also a very hard worker and I am always willing to help others. I am a huge Chicago Cubs fan and I love baseball. I grew up playing baseball and now I enjoy watching it
            and playing fantasy baseball. I also enjoy playing video games with friends, like MLB The Show, Call of Duty, and Minecraft. 
        </p>
        <p>In the summer, I enjoy going on vacation, but I also like staying at home and being with friends. We often have bonfires where we sit and talk about life and what's going on in the world.
            I love spending time with my girlfriend, and we often go on dates to the movies or out to eat. I also enjoy going to church and being involved in my church community. I am a member of the youth group at my church and I enjoy attending youth group events and activities.
