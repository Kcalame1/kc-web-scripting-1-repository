            <h2>Project 1: Eagle Scout Project at local Grade School</h2>

            <p>
                In order to complete the requirements for my Eagle Scout rank, I had to plan, fundraise, and execute a service project that benefited my community. 
                I chose to build a covered bus stop for my local grade school. The bus stop provides shelter for students waiting for the bus and helps to keep them safe from the elements. 
                I worked with a team of volunteers to design and build the bus stop, and we were able to complete the project within the required timeframe. The project was a great success and has been well-received by the school and the community.
            </p>

            <h2>Project 2: Lawn Mowing</h2>

            <p>My second project was a lawn mowing business that I started in my community. I offered lawn care services to my neighbors and family friends. I was responsible for mowing lawns, trimming edges, and maintaining the overall appearance of the properties. 
                The business was a great success and allowed me to earn some extra money while also providing a valuable service to my community. I learned a lot about entrepreneurship, customer service, and time management through this project.
